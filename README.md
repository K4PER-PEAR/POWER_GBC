# POWER_GBC
Power supply designed to be a drop-in replacement for the GameBoy Color (GBC) power supply.

This design was motivated due to obsolescence of components on the GBC power supply making the existing supply unrepairable. A power supply failure would therefore brick the GBC, either requiring acquisition of a functional power supply or use of the motherboard for parts. I have acquired multiple GBCs that have failed power supplies, so this seems to be a common failure point, specifically for the transformer on the supply.
